## Overview
In these notes a data set containing information about 53,939 diamonds is analyzed using univariate, bivariate, multivariate, and explanatory visualizations. The data set shows various values for each diamond, including cut, color, clarity, and various physical dimensions. For the purpose of this lesson the exploratory analysis process is broken down into separate Jupyter Notebooks for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, and also a Notebook for more polished, explanatory visualizations. The file `output_toggle.tpl` is also included to allow the notebooks to be used as slideshows.

## Requirements
This code depends on the following libraries:

1. `numpy`
2. `pandas`
3. `matplotlib.pyplot`
4. `seaborn`

In addition to these, the Jupyter Notebooks assume that the data set, `diamonds.csv` has been extracted and is in the project folder.

The Binder badge above can be used to explore an executable environment for the `Explanatory_Polishing.ipynb` file.
